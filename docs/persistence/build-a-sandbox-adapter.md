# Build a Sandbox Adapter

Your agent runs in a sandbox, and you have to decide what survives a server
restart, a second replica, or a user closing the tab. The answer is not one switch.
A sandboxed run has two halves that persist separately:

- **The sandbox side.** Which provider sandbox to resume for a thread, whether a run
  is still going, and the run's event log.
- **The conversation.** The messages your UI paints when someone reopens a thread.

You can keep both, either one, or neither. This page is the sandbox side, plus the one
place the two meet. It is the third of the adapter walkthroughs, next to
[chat](./build-your-own-chat-adapter) and
[generation](./build-your-own-generation-adapter), and it needs neither of their store
contracts.

## Decide what you store

| You keep | Wire | You get | You give up |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Everything | `withPersistence` + `withSandbox` with `instances`, `runs`, `durability` | Reopen a thread on any device and see the transcript, the tool cards, and a run still in flight | Store size: one run's tool output can be hundreds of kilobytes |
| Sandbox only | `withSandbox` with `instances`, `runs`, `durability`, and no message store | Runs survive a refresh and can be taken over; sandboxes are reused instead of rebuilt | No transcript. A returning client sees the live remainder, not the history |
| Chat only | `withPersistence` alone | The conversation comes back | No sandbox reuse and no takeover. A disconnect destroys the sandbox |
| Neither | Neither middleware | Nothing to operate | Every run starts from a cold sandbox and dies with its socket |

"Sandbox only" is the posture to reach for when the text itself is sensitive. Run
records and the instance map hold ids and timestamps, not what anyone typed.

There is a finer knob inside a stored transcript, because the harness's tool calls
are stored as messages: keep them and reopening a thread rebuilds the tool cards,
or drop them and keep the conversation alone. See
[Trim what you keep](../sandbox/events#trim-what-you-keep).

## Keep everything

`withPersistence` owns the conversation. `withSandbox` owns the sandbox. They meet at
one place: **pass the same `RunStore` to both**, so one record describes the run
instead of two that disagree.

```ts
import { chat } from '@tanstack/ai'
import { withLocks } from '@tanstack/ai/locks'
import { claudeCodeText } from '@tanstack/ai-claude-code'
import { withPersistence } from '@tanstack/ai-persistence'
import { withSandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox'
// Your stores and your `defineSandbox(...)` result.
import { persistence } from './persistence'
import { instances } from './instances'
import { locks } from './locks'
import { sandbox } from './sandbox'

export function agentRun(input: {
  messages: Array<{ role: 'user'; content: string }>
  threadId: string
  runId: string
}) {
  return chat({
    adapter: claudeCodeText('claude-opus-4-8'),
    messages: input.messages,
    threadId: input.threadId,
    runId: input.runId,
    middleware: [
      withPersistence(persistence),
      // Before `withSandbox`: it serializes resume-or-create for one key.
      withLocks(locks),
      withSandbox(sandbox, {
        instances,
        // The SAME store chat persistence uses.
        runs: persistence.stores.runs,
      }),
    ],
  })
}
```

Add `durability` to make the run detachable and replayable; that is
[Takeover & Detached Runs](../sandbox/takeover).

## Keep only the sandbox side

Drop `withPersistence` and the sandbox half still works. It needs two stores of its
own, and neither is a chat store:

- a `RunStore`, which is a core contract, not a persistence-package one.
- a `SandboxInstanceStore`, which is the sandbox's own (see below).

```ts
import { chat } from '@tanstack/ai'
import { withLocks } from '@tanstack/ai/locks'
import { claudeCodeText } from '@tanstack/ai-claude-code'
import { withSandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox'
import { instances } from './instances'
import { locks } from './locks'
// Your own `RunStore`. Nothing here stores a message.
import { runs } from './runs'
import { sandbox } from './sandbox'

export function agentRun(input: {
  messages: Array<{ role: 'user'; content: string }>
  threadId: string
  runId: string
}) {
  return chat({
    adapter: claudeCodeText('claude-opus-4-8'),
    messages: input.messages,
    threadId: input.threadId,
    runId: input.runId,
    middleware: [
      withLocks(locks),
      withSandbox(sandbox, { instances, runs }),
    ],
  })
}
```

A returning client can find the run (`findActiveRun`) and tail its remainder. It
cannot repaint what came before, because nothing stored it.

## Keep only the conversation

`withPersistence` alone. Leave `instances`, `runs` and `durability` off `withSandbox`
and it keeps today's simplest behavior: a fresh sandbox per run, destroyed when the
socket closes. Nothing to implement on the sandbox side at all.

## Implement `SandboxInstanceStore`

This is the sandbox's own contract: a map from a compound key to the provider sandbox
that should be resumed. Three methods, and each one has an invariant the conformance
suite checks.

```ts
import { defineSandboxInstanceStore } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox'
import { db } from './db'

export const instances = defineSandboxInstanceStore({
  // A missing key returns null. It never throws.
  get: (key) => db.sandboxInstances.findByKey(key),

  // A FULL replace, not a merge: omitted optional fields must clear the stored
  // value, or a create-without-snapshot leaves a stale `latestSnapshotId` behind
  // and `ensure` resumes from a snapshot that no longer describes the workspace.
  upsert: (record) => db.sandboxInstances.replace(record),

  // Deleting a key that is not there is a no-op.
  delete: (key) => db.sandboxInstances.remove(key),
})
```

| Method | Invariant |
| --- | --- |
| `get` | A missing key returns `null`. It does not throw. |
| `upsert` | **Full replace** by `record.key`. Omitted optionals clear prior values. |
| `delete` | A missing key is a **no-op**. |
| timestamps | `updatedAt` is epoch **milliseconds**. |

One row per key is enough:

```sql
CREATE TABLE sandbox_instances (
  key                 TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  provider            TEXT NOT NULL,
  provider_sandbox_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  latest_snapshot_id  TEXT,
  thread_id           TEXT NOT NULL,
  latest_run_id       TEXT,
  updated_at          INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```

Put it in the same database as your chat tables if you like. That is your choice, not
a requirement: the sandbox never reads a chat table and chat never reads this one.

`updated_at` is yours to sweep on. The library never deletes rows on a schedule, so
old placements are garbage you collect (see [Reaping & Retention](../sandbox/reaping)).

Hand it to the middleware, or provide it ambiently when a platform layer owns the
wiring:

```ts
import { withSandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox'
import { instances } from './instances'
import { sandbox } from './sandbox'

export const middleware = [withSandbox(sandbox, { instances })]
```

## The four run fields

Durable runs add four optional fields to the `RunStore` record you already use for
chat. Nothing outside the sandbox packages writes them, and a chat-only app can leave
the columns out of its schema entirely.

| Field | Written by | Dropping it breaks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sandboxKey` | `withSandbox` on detach | Nothing can find the detached sandbox again, so it is never reclaimed |
| `detachedSince` | `withSandbox` on detach, cleared on re-attach | The reaper cannot tell a run nobody watches from a live one |
| `cancelRequested` | `requestRunCancel`, out of band | A Stop button cannot reach a run driven by another replica |
| `driverEpoch` | each host that claims the run | Takeover has no fence, so two hosts can drive one run |

One rule matters more than the four names: `update` must treat an **omitted** key and
a key carrying **`undefined`** differently. Omitted means "leave the column alone".
Explicit `undefined` means "clear it", which is how a re-attaching viewer clears
`detachedSince`. A backend that filters `undefined` out of its `SET` clause passes
every other test and then reports healthy runs as permanently detached.

```ts
import type { RunRecord } from '@tanstack/ai'

// One branch of your own `update(runId, patch)`. Key presence, not a value check.
export function detachedSinceColumn(
  patch: Partial<RunRecord>,
  sets: Array<string>,
  params: Array<unknown>,
): void {
  if ('detachedSince' in patch) {
    sets.push('detached_since = ?')
    params.push(patch.detachedSince ?? null)
  }
}
```

Prove it rather than reading the table twice. This suite is separate from
`runPersistenceConformance` precisely because most apps never need it:

```ts
import { runDurableRunFieldsConformance } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox/testkit'
import { persistence } from './persistence'

runDurableRunFieldsConformance('my postgres runs', () => persistence.stores.runs)
```

`listReclaimable` on the same store is also sandbox-only and also optional. Skip it
and `reapDetachedRuns` feature-detects the gap, logs one line and sweeps nothing. See
[Reaping & Retention](../sandbox/reaping).

## Prove it with the conformance suite

Do not hand-write these assertions. `@tanstack/ai-sandbox/testkit` ships the suite
that pins every invariant above, including the full-replace rule that is easy to get
wrong with an `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`:

```ts
import { runSandboxInstanceStoreConformance } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox/testkit'
import { freshDb } from './test-db'

runSandboxInstanceStoreConformance('postgres', async () => {
  const db = await freshDb()
  return db.sandboxInstances
})
```

Three more suites cover the durable-run path, each aimed at one failure that is
painful to find by hand:

- `runJournalConformance`: the agent's output survives as a file a successor can
  replay. See [The Run Journal](../sandbox/journal).
- `runTakeoverConformance`: a second host adopts a detached run and delivers the
  remainder exactly once. See [Takeover & Detached Runs](../sandbox/takeover).
- `runReaperConformance`: a run nobody came back for is finalized or expired, and a
  still-producing one is left alone. See [Reaping & Retention](../sandbox/reaping).

## Where to go next

- [Sandbox Instance Durability](../sandbox/durability) has the wiring and the locking
  rules for the store you just built.
- [Events](../sandbox/events) covers what a stored transcript holds, and how to trim it.
- [Durable Runs Explained](../sandbox/durable-runs) is the same subject in plain language with
  no code, if the postures above felt abrupt.
