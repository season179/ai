Isolate drivers provide the secure sandbox runtimes that [Code Mode](./code-mode.md) uses to execute generated TypeScript. All drivers implement the same `IsolateDriver` interface, so you can swap them without changing any other code.

## Choosing a Driver


|                      | Node (`isolated-vm`)     | QuickJS (WASM)              | QuickJS Bun (`bun:ffi`)  | Cloudflare Workers             | Daytona                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| **Best for**         | Server-side Node.js apps | Browsers, edge, portability | Bun servers              | Edge deployments on Cloudflare | Full remote Linux sandboxes        |
| **Performance**      | Fast (V8 JIT)            | Slower (interpreted)        | Fast (native QuickJS)    | Fast (V8 on Cloudflare edge)   | Fast (native runtime; remote call) |
| **Native deps**      | Yes (C++ addon)          | None                        | None (TinyCC on the fly) | None                           | None                               |
| **Browser support**  | No                       | Yes                         | No (Bun only)            | N/A                            | Yes                                |
| **Memory limit**     | Configurable             | Configurable                | Configurable             | N/A                            | Configurable                       |
| **Stack size limit** | N/A                      | Configurable                | Configurable             | N/A                            | N/A                                |
| **Setup**            | `pnpm add`               | `pnpm add`                  | `bun add`                | Deploy a Worker first          | Create or pass a Daytona sandbox   |

## Node.js Driver (`@tanstack/ai-isolate-node`)

Uses V8 isolates via the [`isolated-vm`](https://github.com/laverdet/isolated-vm) native addon. This is the fastest option for server-side Node.js applications because generated code runs in the same V8 engine as the host, under JIT compilation, with no serialization overhead beyond tool call boundaries.

### Installation

```bash
pnpm add @tanstack/ai-isolate-node
```

`isolated-vm` is a native C++ addon and must be compiled for your platform. It requires Node.js 18 or later.

### Usage

```typescript
import { createNodeIsolateDriver } from '@tanstack/ai-isolate-node'

const driver = createNodeIsolateDriver({
  memoryLimit: 128,   // MB
  timeout: 30_000,    // ms
})
```

### Options


| Option        | Type     | Default | Description                                                                                            |
| ------------- | -------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `memoryLimit` | `number` | `128`   | Maximum heap size for the V8 isolate, in megabytes. Execution is terminated if this limit is exceeded. |
| `timeout`     | `number` | `30000` | Maximum wall-clock time per execution, in milliseconds.                                                |


### How it works

Each `execute_typescript` call creates a fresh V8 isolate. Your tools are bridged into the isolate as async reference functions — when generated code calls `external_myTool(...)`, the call crosses the isolate boundary back into the host Node.js process, executes your tool implementation, and returns the result. Console output (`log`, `error`, `warn`, `info`) is captured and returned in the execution result. The isolate is destroyed after each call.

---

## QuickJS Driver (`@tanstack/ai-isolate-quickjs`)

Uses [QuickJS](https://bellard.org/quickjs/) compiled to WebAssembly via Emscripten. Because the sandbox is a WASM module, it has no native dependencies and runs anywhere JavaScript runs: Node.js, browsers, Deno, Bun, and Cloudflare Workers (without deploying a separate Worker).

### Installation

```bash
pnpm add @tanstack/ai-isolate-quickjs
```

### Usage

```typescript
import { createQuickJSIsolateDriver } from '@tanstack/ai-isolate-quickjs'

const driver = createQuickJSIsolateDriver({
  memoryLimit: 128,     // MB
  timeout: 30_000,      // ms
  maxStackSize: 524288, // bytes (512 KiB)
})
```

### Options


| Option         | Type     | Default  | Description                                                                                                                          |
| -------------- | -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `memoryLimit`  | `number` | `128`    | Maximum heap memory for the QuickJS VM, in megabytes.                                                                                |
| `timeout`      | `number` | `30000`  | Maximum wall-clock time per execution, in milliseconds.                                                                              |
| `maxStackSize` | `number` | `524288` | Maximum call stack size in bytes (default: 512 KiB). Increase for deeply recursive code; decrease to catch runaway recursion sooner. |


### How it works

QuickJS WASM uses an asyncified execution model — the WASM module can pause while awaiting host async functions (your tools). Executions are serialized through a global queue to prevent concurrent WASM calls, which the asyncify model does not support. Fatal errors (memory exhaustion, stack overflow) are detected, the VM is disposed, and a structured error is returned. Console output is captured and returned with the result.

> **Performance note:** QuickJS interprets JavaScript rather than JIT-compiling it, so compute-heavy scripts run slower than with the Node driver. For typical LLM-generated scripts that are mostly waiting on `external_*` tool calls, this difference is not significant.

---

## QuickJS Bun Driver (`@tanstack/ai-isolate-quickjs-bun`)

Runs [QuickJS](https://bellard.org/quickjs/) natively on the [Bun](https://bun.sh/) runtime through `bun:ffi`, via the [`quickjs-bun`](https://github.com/superpowerdotcom/quickjs-bun) package. There are no native dependencies and no build step — the vendored QuickJS C sources are compiled on the fly with Bun's embedded TinyCC, once per process. This makes it the fastest sandboxed option for Code Mode on Bun.

### Installation

```bash
bun add @tanstack/ai-isolate-quickjs-bun
```

Requires Bun 1.3.14 or later. On Windows, provide a prebuilt QuickJS dynamic library via the `QUICKJS_BUN_NATIVE_LIBRARY` environment variable.

### Usage

```typescript
import { createQuickJSBunIsolateDriver } from '@tanstack/ai-isolate-quickjs-bun'

const driver = createQuickJSBunIsolateDriver({
  memoryLimit: 128,     // MB
  timeout: 30_000,      // ms
  maxStackSize: 524288, // bytes (512 KiB)
})
```

### Options


| Option         | Type     | Default  | Description                                                                                                                          |
| -------------- | -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `memoryLimit`  | `number` | `128`    | Maximum heap memory for the QuickJS runtime, in megabytes.                                                                           |
| `timeout`      | `number` | `30000`  | Maximum wall-clock time per execution, in milliseconds.                                                                              |
| `maxStackSize` | `number` | `524288` | Maximum call stack size in bytes (default: 512 KiB). Increase for deeply recursive code; decrease to catch runaway recursion sooner. |
| `maxToolCalls` | `number` | `1000`   | Maximum host tool calls per execution. Bounds output and memory growth from untrusted sandbox code that fans out (e.g. `Promise.all` over a huge array); exceeding it throws a catchable error inside the sandbox. |


### How it works

Each context gets a dedicated native QuickJS runtime with its own memory limit, stack size, and interrupt-based timeout, so contexts execute independently — unlike the WASM driver, which serializes all executions through one shared asyncified WASM module. Fatal errors (memory exhaustion, stack overflow) are detected, the VM is disposed, and a structured error is returned; create a fresh context afterwards. A per-execution `maxToolCalls` budget bounds host tool-call fan-out. Console output is captured and returned with the result.

> **Bun only:** This driver requires Bun 1.3.14 or later and throws a descriptive error when creating a context on Node.js — use the Node or QuickJS WASM driver there. On Bun, prefer this driver over the WASM one: it runs QuickJS natively, and quickjs-emscripten's asyncify bridge is unreliable for async host tool calls under Bun.

## Cloudflare Workers Driver (`@tanstack/ai-isolate-cloudflare`)

Runs generated code inside a [Cloudflare Worker](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) at the edge. Your application server sends code and tool schemas to the Worker via HTTP; the Worker executes the code and calls back when it needs a tool result. This keeps your tool implementations on your server while sandboxed execution happens on Cloudflare's global network.

### Installation

```bash
pnpm add @tanstack/ai-isolate-cloudflare
```

### Usage

```typescript
import { createCloudflareIsolateDriver } from '@tanstack/ai-isolate-cloudflare'

const driver = createCloudflareIsolateDriver({
  workerUrl: 'https://my-code-mode-worker.my-account.workers.dev',
  authorization: process.env.CODE_MODE_WORKER_SECRET,
  timeout: 30_000,
  maxToolRounds: 10,
})
```

### Options


| Option          | Type     | Default | Description                                                                                                                 |
| --------------- | -------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `workerUrl`     | `string` | —       | **Required.** Full URL of the deployed Cloudflare Worker.                                                                   |
| `authorization` | `string` | —       | Optional value sent as the `Authorization` header on every request. Use this to prevent unauthorized access to your Worker. |
| `timeout`       | `number` | `30000` | Maximum wall-clock time for the entire execution (including all tool round-trips), in milliseconds.                         |
| `maxToolRounds` | `number` | `10`    | Maximum number of tool-call/result cycles per execution. Prevents infinite loops when generated code calls tools in a loop. |


### Deploying the Worker

The package exports a ready-made Worker handler at `@tanstack/ai-isolate-cloudflare/worker`. Create a `wrangler.toml` and a worker entry file:

```toml
# wrangler.toml
name = "code-mode-worker"
main = "src/worker.ts"
compatibility_date = "2024-01-01"

[unsafe]
bindings = [{ name = "eval", type = "eval" }]
```

```typescript
// src/worker.ts
export { default } from '@tanstack/ai-isolate-cloudflare/worker'
```

Deploy:

```bash
wrangler deploy
```

### How it works

The driver implements a request/response loop for tool execution:

```
Driver (your server)              Worker (Cloudflare edge)
─────────────────────             ─────────────────────────
Send: code + tool schemas  ──────▶  Execute code
                           ◀──────  Return: needs tool X with args Y
Execute tool X locally
Send: tool result          ──────▶  Resume execution
                           ◀──────  Return: final result / needs tool Z
...repeat until done...
```

Each round-trip adds network latency, so the `maxToolRounds` limit both prevents runaway scripts and caps the maximum number of cross-continent hops. Console output from all rounds is aggregated and returned in the final result.

> **Security:** The Worker requires `UNSAFE_EVAL` (local dev) or the `eval` unsafe binding (production) to execute arbitrary code. Restrict access using the `authorization` option or Cloudflare Access policies.

---

## Daytona Driver (`@tanstack/ai-isolate-daytona`)

Runs generated code inside a Daytona sandbox through `sandbox.process.codeRun`. Your application process still owns TanStack tool implementations; the Daytona sandbox only receives wrapped generated code plus replayed tool results.

### Installation

```bash
pnpm add @tanstack/ai-isolate-daytona
```

If your application creates sandboxes with the official Daytona SDK, also install it:

```bash
pnpm add @daytona/sdk
```

### Usage

```typescript
import { Daytona } from '@daytona/sdk'
import { createDaytonaIsolateDriver } from '@tanstack/ai-isolate-daytona'

const daytona = new Daytona()
const sandbox = await daytona.create({ language: 'typescript' })

const driver = createDaytonaIsolateDriver({
  sandbox,
  timeout: 30_000,
  maxToolRounds: 10,
})
```

### Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `sandbox` | `DaytonaSandboxLike` | — | **Required.** A caller-owned Daytona sandbox-like object with `process.codeRun(code, params?, timeout?)`. |
| `timeout` | `number` | `30000` | Maximum wall-clock time for the entire execution, including replay rounds, in milliseconds. |
| `maxToolRounds` | `number` | `10` | Maximum number of sandbox <-> host tool callback rounds. Prevents infinite loops when generated code repeatedly asks for tools. |

### How it works

The driver uses the same host-owned tool replay shape as the Cloudflare driver without Cloudflare's parent Worker / Dynamic Worker split:

```text
Driver (your server)              Daytona sandbox
─────────────────────             ───────────────
Send: wrapped code        ──────▶  Execute with process.codeRun
                           ◀──────  Return: need_tools with tool requests
Execute tools locally
Replay with toolResults   ──────▶  Continue execution
                           ◀──────  Return: final result / more tool requests
...repeat until done...
```

Use this driver when you want Code Mode execution in a full Daytona sandbox instead of an in-process isolate, QuickJS WASM runtime, or Cloudflare Worker. The sandbox should use a language/runtime capable of executing the JavaScript emitted by Code Mode, and your application remains responsible for sandbox lifecycle, filesystem, network, cleanup, and secret policy. Creating a Code Mode context does not create or delete a Daytona sandbox.

---

## The `IsolateDriver` Interface

All provided drivers satisfy this interface, exported from `@tanstack/ai-code-mode`:

```typescript
import type { ToolBinding, NormalizedError } from "@tanstack/ai-code-mode";

interface IsolateDriver {
  createContext(config: IsolateConfig): Promise<IsolateContext>
}

interface IsolateConfig {
  bindings: Record<string, ToolBinding>
  timeout?: number
  memoryLimit?: number
}

interface IsolateContext {
  execute(code: string): Promise<ExecutionResult>
  dispose(): Promise<void>
}

interface ExecutionResult<T = unknown> {
  success: boolean
  value?: T
  logs: Array<string>
  error?: NormalizedError
}
```

You can implement this interface to build a custom driver — for example, a Docker-based sandbox or a Deno subprocess.
