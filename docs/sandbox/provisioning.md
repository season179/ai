Provisioning is how you hand the in-sandbox agent everything beyond the working
tree: typed secrets, skill repos, MCP servers, plugins, and a universal
instruction file. You declare it all on [`defineWorkspace()`](./workspace), and
each harness adapter projects it into its own native format at bootstrap, so
the same definition works whether the agent is Grok Build, Claude Code, Codex, or OpenCode.

```ts
import {
  bearer,
  createSecrets,
  defineWorkspace,
  fileSkill,
  gitSkill,
  githubRepo,
  mcpSkill,
} from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox'

const secrets = createSecrets({
  GH: process.env.GH_TOKEN ?? '',
  SENTRY: process.env.SENTRY_TOKEN ?? '',
})

defineWorkspace({
  source: githubRepo({ repo: 'owner/repo', ref: 'main' }),
  secrets,
  skills: [
    gitSkill({ repo: 'owner/tanstack-skills' }),
    gitSkill({ repo: 'owner/private-skills', secret: secrets.GH }),
    mcpSkill('my-mcp', {
      url: 'https://mcp.example.com',
      headers: { Authorization: bearer(secrets.SENTRY) },
    }),
    fileSkill({ path: '.agent-hints.md', content: '# Hints\nPrefer pnpm.' }),
  ],
  plugins: ['@anthropic/plugin-foo'],
  instructions: 'Always run `pnpm test` before proposing a change.',
})
```

## Type-safe secrets

`createSecrets` turns plain environment values into opaque `SecretRef` tokens.
You pass the refs around your config; the underlying strings stay out of every
serializable surface.

```ts
import { createSecrets, defineWorkspace, githubRepo } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox'

const secrets = createSecrets({
  GH: process.env.GH_TOKEN ?? '',
  SENTRY: process.env.SENTRY_TOKEN ?? '',
})

defineWorkspace({
  source: githubRepo({ repo: 'owner/repo', ref: 'main' }),
  secrets,
})
```

`secrets` is [declared on the workspace](./workspace), and the values are
injected into the sandbox env at create/resume time.

### Why the values never leak

The real strings are held in a **non-enumerable, symbol-keyed registry** on the
object `createSecrets` returns. Each property you access (`secrets.GH`) is a
`SecretRef` token, not the string. Because the registry is symbol-keyed and
non-enumerable:

- `Object.keys(secrets)`, spreads, and `JSON.stringify(secrets)` never expose
  the values.
- The values are **never written to snapshots, the sandbox store, or the event
  log**. They are resolved only at the moment the sandbox env is built.

This is what makes the workspace definition safe to hash, persist, and replay
for resume bookkeeping without ever persisting a credential.

### Passing a secret where a `SecretRef` is accepted

Hand a ref directly to any field that takes one. The clearest example is
`gitSkill` auth: pass `secret: secrets.GH` and the token is resolved only when
the repo is cloned:

```ts
import { createSecrets, defineWorkspace, gitSkill, githubRepo } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox'

const secrets = createSecrets({ GH: process.env.GH_TOKEN ?? '' })

defineWorkspace({
  source: githubRepo({ repo: 'owner/repo' }),
  secrets,
  skills: [gitSkill({ repo: 'owner/private-skills', secret: secrets.GH })],
})
```

### `bearer(ref)` for header values

In MCP header values you can use a ref directly, or wrap it with `bearer(ref)`
to produce a `Bearer <value>` string at resolution time:

```ts
import { bearer, createSecrets, mcpSkill } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox'

const secrets = createSecrets({
  GH: process.env.GH_TOKEN ?? '',
  SENTRY: process.env.SENTRY_TOKEN ?? '',
})

mcpSkill('my-mcp', {
  url: 'https://mcp.example.com',
  headers: {
    Authorization: bearer(secrets.SENTRY), // resolves to "Bearer <value>"
    'X-Token': secrets.GH, // resolves to the raw token value
  },
})
```

## Skills, plugins, and MCP servers

`skills` is an array of skill values that provision capabilities into the
agent's environment. There are four builders, each describing a different kind
of capability:

| Builder      | What it provisions                                                                 |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `agentSkill` | A named public skill (portable placeholder; Claude Code warns and skips it, so use `gitSkill` instead). |
| `gitSkill`   | A skill repo cloned into the workspace, with optional auth and clone path.         |
| `mcpSkill`   | A third-party MCP server, with URL and headers.                                    |
| `fileSkill`  | An arbitrary file written into the workspace.                                      |

```ts
import {
  bearer,
  createSecrets,
  defineWorkspace,
  fileSkill,
  gitSkill,
  githubRepo,
  mcpSkill,
} from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox'

const secrets = createSecrets({
  GH: process.env.GH_TOKEN ?? '',
  SENTRY: process.env.SENTRY_TOKEN ?? '',
})

defineWorkspace({
  source: githubRepo({ repo: 'owner/repo' }),
  secrets,
  skills: [
    // Clone a public skill repo (preferred over agentSkill on Claude Code).
    gitSkill({ repo: 'owner/tanstack-skills' }),
    // Clone a private skill repo; `secret` is resolved from the secrets registry.
    gitSkill({ repo: 'owner/private-skills', secret: secrets.GH }),
    // Wire an MCP server with a resolved bearer token in the Authorization header.
    mcpSkill('my-mcp', {
      url: 'https://mcp.example.com',
      headers: { Authorization: bearer(secrets.SENTRY) },
    }),
    // Write an arbitrary file into the workspace.
    fileSkill({ path: '.agent-hints.md', content: '# Hints\nPrefer pnpm.' }),
  ],
  plugins: ['@anthropic/plugin-foo'],
})
```

### `gitSkill` clone path

`gitSkill` takes an optional `into` field, an **absolute path inside the
sandbox**, controlling where the repo is cloned. It defaults to
`.tanstack-skills/<repo-basename>`:

```ts
import { createSecrets, defineWorkspace, gitSkill, githubRepo } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox'

const secrets = createSecrets({ GH: process.env.GH_TOKEN ?? '' })

defineWorkspace({
  source: githubRepo({ repo: 'owner/repo' }),
  secrets,
  skills: [
    gitSkill({
      repo: 'owner/private-skills',
      secret: secrets.GH,
      into: '/workspace/.skills/private',
    }),
  ],
})
```

### Per-harness projection

At bootstrap each harness projector maps these values into its CLI's native
format:

| Harness     | MCP servers projected to |
| ----------- | ------------------------ |
| Claude Code | `.mcp.json`              |
| Codex       | `.codex/config.toml`     |
| OpenCode    | `opencode.json`          |

A concept a given CLI lacks (for example, `plugins` on Codex) **emits a
warning and is silently skipped** rather than throwing. The same applies to
`agentSkill` on Claude Code: there is no reliable primitive to install a public
skill by bare name, so the projector warns and skips it. Prefer `gitSkill` (or a
`plugins` entry) when you need that skill on Claude Code. That keeps one
portable definition usable across harnesses: you declare everything once, and
each agent takes the parts it understands.

> These MCP servers are third-party services you point the agent at. Bridging
> your **own app's host tools** into the agent (a `chat()` server tool whose
> `execute()` runs back on the host) is a different mechanism, see
> [Tools](./tools).

## `AGENTS.md` and per-harness symlinks

`instructions` is a string written to `AGENTS.md` at the workspace root during
bootstrap. Harness-specific counterparts (`CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`) are
created as **symlinks** to it; if the sandbox process layer cannot symlink, they
are written as copies instead. Either way the instruction content is read
natively by every supported CLI without extra config.

```ts
import { defineWorkspace, githubRepo } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox'

defineWorkspace({
  source: githubRepo({ repo: 'owner/repo' }),
  instructions: 'Always run `pnpm test` before proposing a change.',
})
```

> Use `instructions` for guidance you want the agent to always follow. To
> constrain what it is *allowed* to do, which commands and capabilities are
> allowed, asked about, or denied, reach for [Policy](./policy) instead.
