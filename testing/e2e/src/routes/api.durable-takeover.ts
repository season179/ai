/**
 * Durable, detachable sandboxed runs over real HTTP: detach on disconnect,
 * takeover, out-of-band cancel vs. plain disconnect, and the single-writer
 * epoch fence.
 *
 * WHAT IS REAL AND WHAT IS A STAND-IN. Everything that decides the behaviors
 * under test is production code — `withSandbox`'s durability resolution and its
 * detach-vs-destroy `onAbort` branch, `withPersistence`'s
 * `DetachableRunCapability` branch, `requestRunCancel` / `wasCancelRequested` /
 * `RUN_CANCEL_REASON`, `resolveDurableRunId`, `alignedIfAttaching`
 * (`alignToStoredLog`), `sandboxRunDriver`'s claim and BOTH its fences, core's
 * `startRunDriver`, and — for the sweep — `reapDetachedRuns`, `probeRunExit`,
 * `pruneJournals` and `sandboxReclaimer`. Two things are stand-ins:
 *
 * - **The sandbox provider** is a fake handle (no container). It records every
 *   `destroy` per sandbox key, which is how "an explicit cancel tears the
 *   sandbox down" is asserted.
 * - **The agent's journal** is a counter instead of an NDJSON file inside the
 *   sandbox. The substitution keeps the property the journal exists for: the
 *   agent's output lives OUTSIDE the request, so it survives the client
 *   disconnect and a later attach re-reads it from the first line. The counter
 *   advances only on an explicit `?action=tick`, so a test controls exactly
 *   where mid-stream it disconnects — no timers, no sleeps, no flake. The
 *   counter is ALSO projected as a real NDJSON file in a fake journal directory
 *   (see `journalDirs`), because `probeRunExit` and `pruneJournals` read that
 *   directory through `handle.process.exec` and parse its stdout — so those two
 *   run for real rather than being stubbed.
 *
 * Provider-free (no LLM in the loop), so this route is exempt from the aimock
 * policy, like the other durability harness routes.
 *
 * Actions, all keyed by a caller-supplied `runId` that must be unique per test:
 *
 * - `POST ?runId&threadId&total` — start a fresh durable run over SSE.
 * - `POST ?action=tick&runId&n` — advance the agent's journal by `n` lines.
 * - `POST ?action=drop&runId` — the client disconnect (see `dropResponse`).
 * - `POST ?action=seed&runId&threadId&total&lines&detachedSince` — construct the
 *   takeover PRECONDITION directly: a running record, a detached marker, a live
 *   agent, and an OPEN log holding the prefix a previous host delivered. See
 *   "Why seeding exists" below.
 * - `GET  ?runId&offset=-1` — attach: replay the log AND take the run over.
 * - `POST ?action=cancel&runId&band=both|durable|inprocess` — out-of-band cancel.
 * - `POST ?action=reap&runId…&now&runBudgetMs` — one reaper sweep, scoped to the
 *   runIds named (repeat `runId`), plus one journal-directory sweep per sandbox
 *   those runs live in. See {@link reapResponse}.
 * - `GET  ?action=state&runId` — the observable server state, as JSON.
 *
 * Any request may add `?nondeterministic=1` alongside its `runId` to make that
 * run's translator mint a message id that is NOT run-scoped — see
 * {@link nondeterministicRuns}.
 *
 * WHY SEEDING EXISTS. A takeover's documented precondition is "record still
 * `running`, delivery log OPEN and holding what was already delivered, agent
 * still working". `?action=seed` writes exactly that, with the same translator a
 * live host would have used, so the takeover machinery can be exercised in
 * isolation from whatever produced the prefix — no disconnect timing, no
 * dependence on the producing host at all.
 *
 * A real `?action=drop` now produces the same precondition (core's delivery sink
 * leaves a DETACHED run's log open — see `RunDetachedCapability`), and the spec
 * pins the disconnect→takeover path end to end as well. Seeding is kept because
 * the two prove different things: seeding proves a takeover can pick up a prefix
 * it did not produce, which is the cross-host case a single-process test cannot
 * otherwise reach.
