/**
 * Durable, detachable sandboxed runs over real HTTP.
 *
 * The five behaviors this phase added, each pinned here:
 *
 * 1. A takeover resumes a detached run and delivers the remainder with the
 *    delivered prefix suppressed — the log holds each chunk exactly once. Pinned
 *    both from a seeded precondition and from a REAL disconnect.
 * 2. A plain disconnect does NOT terminalize the run: the record stays
 *    `'running'` with no `finishedAt` and no `error`, and gains `detachedSince`
 *    + `sandboxKey`.
 * 3. An explicit cancel DOES tear down — in either band — destroying the
 *    sandbox and writing a terminal `'aborted'`.
 * 4. Cancel and disconnect are distinguished even though the connection close is
 *    byte-identical.
 * 5. A superseded driver corrupts nothing: it writes NOTHING to the log (not
 *    even an error chunk) and cannot mark the record terminal, while the winner
 *    completes normally.
 * 6. The reaper handles the case every other test here leaves hanging — nobody
 *    ever comes back: it finalizes a run that reached its sentinel while
 *    detached (which is the only way that transcript is ever saved), expires one
 *    past its TTL, and leaves a still-producing one completely untouched.
 * 7. A replay that stopped being deterministic fails the attach LOUDLY instead of
 *    delivering the prefix twice.
 *
 * Harness: `/api/durable-takeover`. Provider-free (no LLM), so it is exempt from
 * the aimock policy like the other durability harness routes. The agent's
 * journal advances only on an explicit `?action=tick`, so every disconnect
 * happens at a known point in the stream — no timers, no sleeps.
 *
 * Every test mints its own `runId`, because shared run state has produced false
 * passes on this feature before, and every wait is explicitly bounded: an attach
 * against a run with no journal used to hang forever, and a hung test stalls CI
 * instead of failing it.
 */

/**
 * Generous per-test budget, deliberately larger than every wait inside these
 * tests. These specs share one dev server with the rest of the suite, and under
 * full parallel load a correct run can be slow; each wait below has its own
 * explicit, shorter deadline with a message that says what it was waiting for,
 * so a real failure still reports itself instead of being cut off by the runner.
