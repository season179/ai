/**
 * Deterministic chunk identity — the prerequisite that makes journal replay
 * exact.
 *
 * The design premise is that re-translating a journal prefix reproduces the
 * chunks a previous host already delivered, so a successor can recognize and
 * skip them (see `align.ts`, a later task). Two things in the default path
 * break that premise:
 *
 * 1. `ChatAdapter.generateId()` — `packages/ai/src/activities/chat/adapter.ts:227`,
 *    read directly for this task — is:
 *
 *    ```ts
 *    protected generateId(): string {
 *      return `${this.name}-${Date.now()}-${Math.random().toString(36).substring(7)}`
 *    }
 *    ```
 *
 *    and every harness translator mints message ids through it (wired as
 *    `genId` in the Grok Build, Claude Code, and Codex text adapters). Both
 *    `Date.now()` and `Math.random()` are non-reproducible: replaying the same
 *    journal bytes through a second `generateId()` call produces a different
 *    id every time, so "same bytes ⇒ same chunks" is false on the journaled
 *    path today. {@link createRunScopedIdGen} replaces it with a run-scoped
 *    counter that has neither a clock nor randomness, so two generators built
 *    from the same `runId` always produce the same sequence.
 * 2. Chunks also carry `timestamp: Date.now()`, which cannot be reproduced at
 *    all, deterministic id or not. {@link chunkFingerprint} therefore excludes
 *    exactly that field — nothing downstream keys on a chunk's timestamp, so
 *    leaving it wall-clock is safe, but every other field must participate in
 *    the comparison or a real divergence would go undetected.
 */

 *   cannot spuriously diverge.
 * - **Recurses into nested arrays and objects**: tool-call arguments are
