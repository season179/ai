/**
 * `withSandbox(definition, options?)` — the middleware that PROVIDES the

 * - `setup`: resume-or-create the sandbox (via the definition's ensure
 *   algorithm), provide the handle, using the durability seams from
 *   {@link SandboxMiddlewareOptions} (or, failing that, a bus-provided
 *   SandboxInstanceStoreCapability / LocksCapability, then an in-memory
 *   fallback). If `fileEvents` is not false, starts a
 *   watcher that dispatches to sandbox-scoped hooks and forwards to the runtime
 *   sink.
 * - `onFinish`/`onAbort`/`onError`: stop the watcher, snapshot (`after-run`)
 *   and/or destroy per lifecycle.
 *
 * NOTE: streamed sandbox lifecycle events (sandbox.created, workspace.setup.*)
 * are emitted by the harness adapter's chatStream (which can yield CUSTOM
 * chunks), not from here — middleware setup runs before streaming begins.
