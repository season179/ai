/**
 * Coverage for the run RECORD half of the fence (`fenceRunStore` in
 * `src/claim.ts`), driven through the code path that actually reaches it:
 * `pipeToRunLog`.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM `claim.test.ts`. Fencing the event log
 * only moved the harm. A superseded driver's refused append throws
 * `RunClaimLostError`, `pipeToRunLog` catches it and calls
 * `finish(ctx, 'failed', …)`, and that `runs.update` used to be unfenced — so the
 * dead host could not poison the successor's log but still marked the successor's
 * live run terminal. `isTerminalRunStatus` then answers `true` for a run that is
 * streaming, which is exactly what `findActiveRun`, the resume driver's
 * skip-if-terminal check, and the Phase 4 reaper branch on. Every test here is
 * written so that removing the suppression makes it fail.
 *
 * THE TWO FAILURE MODES ARE BOTH COVERED, because the fix has a worse sibling:
 * suppressing too much. A never-terminal run is worse than a falsely-terminal
 * one, so the successor's own terminal write and an unsuperseded run's genuine
 * `'failed'` are asserted alongside, and `close()` is asserted on the suppressed
 * path — a suppression that took the teardown with it would wedge the record at
 * `'running'` with every live tailer parked forever.
 *
 * Every claim below gets its OWN `runId`, and every assertion about stored events
 * goes through `await log.snapshot()` — `fakeLog` copies its seed array, so
 * asserting against the array handed to it is vacuous.
