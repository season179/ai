/**
 * Coverage for `sandboxRunDriver` (`src/driver.ts`) — the wiring that fills in
 * core's injected `claim`/`pipe` seams with this package's real ones.
 *
 * This file is written adversarially against the three ways the wiring can be
 * wrong while still *looking* right (a test that only asserted "pipe was
 * called" would pass against all three):
 *
 * 1. **The epoch actually carried into the fence.** `pipe` gets no epoch from
 *    core, so the wiring must carry the acquired claim across. A hardcoded
 *    epoch (`0`) is not a weak fence, it is a permanently tripped one:
 *    `withRunClaim` bumps `driverEpoch` to `1` before `fn` runs, so
 *    `observed > claim.epoch` holds on the first append and every takeover
 *    fails. Hence the paired assertions: the fence must PERMIT an append at the
 *    acquired epoch and REFUSE one at a superseded epoch, with the refused path
 *    proven by `snapshot()` — the driven chunk must not be in it.
 * 2. **`close()` must not be fenced.** It runs on the very teardown caused by
 *    losing the claim, so fencing it wedges the record at `'running'` with every
 *    tailer parked forever. The `'close'` op is asserted on the refused path,
 *    which is exactly where a fenced close would throw.
 * 3. **Quiescence before the first append.** Asserted by op ORDER, not by a spy
 *    count: dropping the gate makes the first recorded op an `append`.
 *
 * Every assertion about stored events goes through `(await log.snapshot())` and
 * never through an array handed to `fakeLog` — `fakeLog` COPIES its seed, so
 * asserting on the seed array is vacuous.
