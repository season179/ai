/**
 * `withSandbox`'s detach-vs-destroy gating, in BOTH directions.
 *
 * The behavior under test is the one observable change of the durability work:
 * a client disconnect on a run whose `withSandbox` was given both `runs` and
 * `durability` no longer destroys the sandbox — it records `detachedSince` and
 * `sandboxKey` and returns. Every other configuration keeps today's
 * always-destroy behavior, which is what makes this change invisible to every
 * app that has not opted in.
 *
 * Every test drives the REAL middleware object returned by `withSandbox` (its
 * `setup` and `onAbort` are called directly), never a re-implementation of the
 * hook bodies, so the assertions pin production code rather than a sketch of it.
