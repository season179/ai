/**
 * Durable-run wiring for the Grok Build NDJSON path: the journal options the
 * spawn receives, and the alignment an ATTACHING run routes through.
 *
 * These tests deliberately drive the real `localProcessSandbox` rather than a
 * fake handle, because the two things under test are both path-derived: the
 * journal file location comes from `runId` + the configured directory through a
 * shell redirect, and the attach read finds (or does not find) that exact file.
 * A fake `process.spawn` would let a wrong path pass.
 *
 * WHICH SEAM IS UNDER TEST. `ai-grok-build` has two protocol paths and only one
 * of them journals:
 *
 * - `chatStreamAcp` (protocol `'acp'`, the default) merges `translateAcpStream`
 *   with the bridge channel via `mergeChunkStreams`. It never calls
 *   `spawnNdjson`, so it writes no journal and has no stored log to replay.
 * - `chatStreamNdjson` (protocol `'streaming-json'`) is the journaled path:
 *   `spawnNdjson(..., { journal })` then `translateThreadEvents`.
 *
 * So the alignment seam is `translateThreadEvents`, NOT the ACP merge. Every
 * assertion below is on the streaming-json path, and `aligns the final
 * translated chunk sequence…` fails outright if the wrap is moved to the ACP
 * merge, because that leaves this path unaligned.
