  // Destroying the stream is NOT sufficient on its own and must never be the

  // leaves the exec's process running (measured — a `sleep` spawned through
  // this handle survived `kill()` and was still in the container's `ps` until
  // the container itself was removed). That is precisely the orphan leak this
  // capability promises callers is impossible, and `journal-reader` reads it to
  // choose its `'follow'` (killable) vs `'poll'` strategy.
  //
  // WHY `true` IS EARNED HERE, when the same audit flipped Vercel and Daytona
  // to `false`. Those two could not distinguish a refused kill from a successful
  // one, so their `true` was a claim no observation could contradict. This one
  // is falsifiable in three independent ways, and each is exercised by a test:
  //   1. `kill()` AWAITS the in-container kill, so its resolution means the
  //      container was asked and answered — not that a request was queued.
  //   2. `killRecordedPidCommand` VERIFIES with `kill -0` after escalating to
  //      `SIGKILL` and prints a marker on stderr when the process is still
  //      there; `killRecordedPid` turns that into a `logger.warn`. A kill this
  //      handle could not perform is therefore reported, not assumed.
  //   3. `docker.test.ts` asks the container's own `ps` whether the probe is
  //      gone — evidence from the kernel, not from this constant.
  // Point 2 only counts while the channel STAYS QUIET on healthy teardowns. It
  // did not: `followJournal` kills in a `finally` on every exit path, so once the
  // pid file was removed on clean exit, "absent" meant both "not written yet" and
  // "the owner exited and we cleaned up" — and every ordinary teardown warned
  // about an orphan that did not exist (and blocked ~2s doing so). A warning that
  // fires when nothing is wrong is not evidence of anything, so the handle now
  // tracks WHICH of the two happened (`PidFileState`) instead of guessing from
  // the file. `docker.test.ts` pins both directions: silence after a clean exit,
  // and a warning — with the survivor still in `ps` — after a real refusal.
  //
  // If the pid was never recorded (the process died before its `echo $$`, or the
  // exec never started) that too is reported, via `KILL_NO_PID_MARKER`. The
  // residual gap is honest and narrow: a kill can still be refused, and then
