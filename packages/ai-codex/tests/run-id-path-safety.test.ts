/**
 * Durability made `runId` CALLER-chosen, and this adapter interpolates it into a
 * filesystem path: the stdin-fallback prompt file
 * (`/tmp/tanstack-codex-prompt-${runId}`, taken when
 * `sandbox.capabilities.writableStdin === false`). Raw, that is three separate
 * hazards — a `/` silently turns the basename into a nested path, `..` climbs out
 * of `/tmp` entirely, and an over-long id fails the spawn with `ENAMETOOLONG`.
 *
 * So the id goes through `encodeRunId`, the same encoder `journalPaths` uses.
 *
 * WHAT TO ASSERT, precisely. The encoded token still CONTAINS `..` — `.` is a
 * pass-through-safe character, so `encodeRunId('..')` is `'..'`. That is not a
 * defect and asserting its absence would be asserting the wrong thing. Traversal
 * is defeated by escaping the SEPARATOR: with no `/` in the token, `..` is inert
 * text inside one path segment and has nothing to climb. These tests therefore
 * pin the absence of `/` and the exact single-segment shape, never the absence of
 * `..`.
 *
 * This is path safety, not shell injection: `q()` already quotes every value
 * that reaches a shell, and the assertions below deliberately do not re-test it.
