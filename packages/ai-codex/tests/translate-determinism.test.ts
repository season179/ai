/**
 * Determinism of the codex translator on the journaled path.
 *
 * WHAT THIS COVERS: `translateThreadEvents` mints message ids only through
 * `ctx.genId` (used for `TOOL_CALL_RESULT.messageId`, both the resolved-item
 * path and `synthesizeUnresolvedResults`). Replaying the exact same journal
 * bytes through a fresh `createRunScopedIdGen(runId)` each time must produce
 * an identical chunk sequence (compared via `chunkFingerprint`, which drops
 * only the wall-clock `timestamp` field) — this is the load-bearing property
 * `alignToStoredLog` (a later phase) depends on to recognize what a previous
 * host already delivered and suppress it.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT COVER: in the real adapter
 * (`packages/ai-codex/src/adapters/text.ts`), `translateThreadEvents`'s
 * output is not what gets delivered on its own — it is piped through
 * `mergeChunkStreams(translated, channel.stream)`, where `channel.stream`
 * carries CUSTOM events from the host-tool-bridge, produced by *live* tool
 * execution. On a journal replay:
 *   1. No live tools run, so those bridged events do not occur at all.
 *   2. Even for the original run, where they interleave relative to the
 *      translated chunks is timing-dependent, not something recoverable
 *      from the journal.
 * So a deterministic translator (proven here) does NOT imply the adapter's
 * actually-delivered, post-merge stream is deterministic for any run that
 * used bridged tools. This test only exercises `translateThreadEvents` in
 * isolation and intentionally makes no claim about `mergeChunkStreams`
 * output — that gap is left open for Phase 3 to scope, not fixed here.
