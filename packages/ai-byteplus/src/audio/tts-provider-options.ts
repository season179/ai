 * Seed Speech voice identifier (`speaker` on the wire).

 * TTS 2.0. The generation suffix matters when picking one:
 *
 * - `_uranus_bigtts` — TTS 2.0 voices (the current generation).
 * - `_mars_bigtts` / `_moon_bigtts` — TTS 1.0 voices.
 * - `*_emo_v2_*` — TTS 1.0 voices that additionally accept emotion tags.
 *
 * The full roster lives at
 * https://docs.byteplus.com/en/docs/byteplusvoice/voicelist and changes far
 * more often than this package ships, so the union stays open: any string is
 * accepted, and the one listed id is the adapter's default.
