/**
 * Provider options and per-model capability tables for the BytePlus Seedance
 * video models.
 *
 * Every applicability claim below was probed live against
 * `https://ark.ap-southeast.bytepluses.com/api/v3` on 2026-07-31. The probe
 * sent an out-of-range `seed` alongside the field under test, so requests that
 * passed validation still failed before a task was created (nothing billed):
 * an error naming the field under test means "rejected", an error naming
 * `seed` means "accepted". Ark reports only one arbitrary invalid parameter
 * per request, so each cell was retried until a verdict repeated.
 *
 * Ark rejects an inapplicable field outright — "the specified parameter
 * `draft` is not supported for model seedance-1-0-pro in t2v, must be empty" —
 * so these tables are not cosmetic: sending a field to the wrong model is a
 * 400, not a no-op.
 *
 * **Where the adapter guards, and where it doesn't** (deliberate, not an
 * oversight). Scalar applicability — `service_tier`, `draft`, `priority`,
 * `frames`, `camera_fixed` — is left to Ark, whose 400 names the offending
 * field and the model precisely enough to act on, and whose per-model rules
 * shift as BytePlus ships models. Duplicating that here would mean a table
 * that silently goes stale and starts rejecting requests the API would have
 * accepted. The adapter guards locally only where the API's own error is
 * misleading or arrives too late to be actionable: prompt media shape (role
 * vocabulary, frame-vs-reference exclusivity, frame cardinality) and the
 * resolution tier, both of which are derived from a caller's `prompt` /
 * `size` rather than passed through verbatim.
 *
 * @experimental Video generation is an experimental feature and may change.
