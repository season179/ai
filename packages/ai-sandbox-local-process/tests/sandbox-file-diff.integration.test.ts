/**
 * REAL-HANDLE integration test for the `sandbox.file` / `sandbox.file.diff`
 * stream events (as opposed to the fake-handle unit tests in
 * `packages/ai-sandbox/tests/with-sandbox-hooks.test.ts`).
 *
 * Lives in `ai-sandbox-local-process` (not `ai-sandbox`) so it can drive a
 * REAL `localProcessSandbox` handle using only public exports — `ai-sandbox`
 * already depends on nothing here, and `ai-sandbox-local-process` already
 * depends on `@tanstack/ai-sandbox`, so this avoids introducing a reverse
 * workspace devDependency (`ai-sandbox` -> `ai-sandbox-local-process`) just
 * for a test.
 *
 * The full browser E2E harness (`testing/e2e`) can't exercise sandboxes, so
 * this substitutes for it: it drives a genuine `localProcessSandbox` handle —
 * a real host tmp directory, a real `git` repo, real `fs.write`, and (on
 * non-Linux platforms, including this Windows dev box) a real native
 * `fs.watch` — through `withSandbox({ fileEvents: { diff: true } })`, and
 * asserts the emitted CUSTOM chunks end-to-end.
 *
 * Approach used: REAL handle (not the controllable-fake fallback). The only
 * wrinkle driving a real handle surfaced was a genuine bug in
 * `buildFileHookEvent`'s `diff()` accessor (in `ai-sandbox/src/file-diff.ts`)
 * — it passed the *virtual* sandbox path (e.g. `/workspace/notes.txt`)
 * straight to `git diff -- <path>` instead of relativizing it the way
 * `before()` already does. Since the real local-process repo root is a host
 * tmp dir (not literally `/workspace`), git resolves a leading `/` against
 * the filesystem root and fails with "fatal: Invalid path" — so `diff()`
 * silently fell back to `''` on every platform. Fixed in that file (see
 * `packages/ai-sandbox/tests/file-diff.test.ts` for the accompanying
 * unit-level regression coverage) so this integration test can actually
 * observe a real, non-empty diff.
 *
 * We reuse the exact runtime-sink shape production code builds in
 * `packages/ai/src/activities/chat/index.ts` (`createCustomEventChunk`) via
 * `provideSandboxRuntime`, the same seam `with-sandbox-hooks.test.ts` drives
 * directly (its production caller, the chat engine's `MiddlewareRunner`, is
 * an internal symbol of `@tanstack/ai` not exposed outside that package, so
 * it isn't reachable from a downstream package either — the `sandbox`-hook
 * fan-out it performs is already covered by
 * `packages/ai/tests/sandbox-runtime-emit.test.ts`).
