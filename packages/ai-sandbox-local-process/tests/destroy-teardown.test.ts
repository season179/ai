/**
 * Teardown must WAIT for the OS, not race it.
 *
 * `destroy()` used to `fsp.rm` the backing dir with no retries and without
 * touching the processes it had spawned. Every spawned command runs with that
 * dir as its CWD, and on Windows a directory that is a live process's CWD
 * cannot be removed — so the removal threw
 * `EBUSY: resource busy or locked, rmdir '…'`. Measured at a clean HEAD: 6-13
 * of 53 `ai-acp` tests lost per run, and one `ai-grok-build` test.
 *
 * POSIX `rmdir` tolerates open handles, so the EBUSY itself is Windows-only.
 * The behaviour asserted here is not: destroying a sandbox must terminate the
 * processes it owns and confirm they are gone, which is checkable everywhere.
 * The Windows-only case is called out where the platform is what makes the
 * assertion bite.
