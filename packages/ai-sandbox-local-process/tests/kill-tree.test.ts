/**
 * Regression coverage for the `killTree` orphan leak.
 *
 * THE DEFECT. On Windows with a git-bash `sh`, a multi-statement command — e.g.
 * `journalFollowCommand`'s `mkdir -p …; : >> …; tail -c +1 -f …` — has its final
 * `tail` spawned by an intermediate `sh.exe` that MSYS's fork emulation then
 * exits. Windows never reparents, so `tail.exe`'s `ParentProcessId` keeps
 * pointing at that dead pid, and `taskkill /PID <sh> /T /F` — which walks only
 * LIVE parent links — never reaches it while still exiting `0`. Every follow read
 * leaked a `tail.exe` for the life of the machine (measured: 2 per run of the
 * journal conformance suite, 4 per run of the takeover suite).
 *
 * WHAT IS PORTABLE AND WHAT IS NOT. The attribution logic
 * (`parseMsysProcessTable` + `msysDescendantWinPids`) is pure text→pids and is
 * tested everywhere. The end-to-end proof is NOT portable and is Windows-gated:
 * it needs the MSYS process table, which exists only under git-bash, and the leak
 * itself is a Windows-only consequence of MSYS fork emulation. It is also
 * meaningless under Docker (that provider's `tail` dies with its container) and
 * on POSIX (`sh` really is `tail`'s parent, so signalling the wrapper suffices).
 * A host process census cannot be written once and trusted everywhere — so
 * rather than a test that passes everywhere for the wrong reason, the real
 * assertion self-skips off Windows and says why.
