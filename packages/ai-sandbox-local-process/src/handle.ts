/**
 * Kill a spawned child AND all its descendants.

 * We spawn every command through `sh -c <command>`, so `child` is the `sh`
 * wrapper. `child.kill()` signals only that wrapper — its grandchildren (e.g.
 * `node` → a harness binary like `opencode serve`) keep running and hold their
 * ports, orphaning a server that then blocks the next run's port.
 *
 * ON POSIX we signal the process GROUP (`process.kill(-pid, …)`), which is why
 * `spawn` passes `detached: true` (see {@link spawnDetached}) to make the
 * wrapper its own group leader. Signalling the bare wrapper is NOT enough, and
 * the comment that used to sit here — "sh forwards on exec" — was wrong: `sh -c
 * '<cmd>'` does not reliably exec its command. Measured on Linux (node:22,
 * `/bin/sh` → dash): `sh -c 'sleep 987654321'` shows BOTH `sh` and `sleep` in
 * `ps`, and `child.kill('SIGKILL')` leaves `sleep` running. That is the POSIX
 * twin of the Windows `tail.exe` leak below, and it made
 * `killableProcesses: true` false on every platform.
 *
 * ON WINDOWS there are no process groups, so we walk the tree with
 * `taskkill /T` and then sweep what `/T` cannot reach.
 *
 * WHY `taskkill /T` IS NOT ENOUGH (measured, git-bash `sh` on Windows 11). For a
 * multi-statement command — e.g. `journalFollowCommand`'s
 * `mkdir -p …; : >> …; tail -c +1 -f …` — MSYS's fork emulation runs the final
 * `tail` under an intermediate `sh.exe` that then exits. Windows does not
 * reparent, so `tail.exe`'s `ParentProcessId` stays pointing at that dead pid and
 * `taskkill /T` — which walks only LIVE parent links from the pid it is given —
 * never reaches it. Worse, taskkill still exits `0` ("SUCCESS: … PID <sh> has
 * been terminated"), so checking the exit status alone does not catch this: the
 * shipped journal conformance suite leaked 2 `tail.exe` per run, accumulating
 * for the life of the machine.
 *
 * MSYS's own pid table does keep the logical parentage (`ps` reports `tail`'s
 * PPID as our `sh`), so we snapshot it, resolve the descendants' Windows pids,
 * and kill the survivors directly. The snapshot MUST be taken BEFORE the
 * `taskkill`: once our `sh` is gone, its `winpid` is no longer in the table and
 * the attribution is lost.
 *
 * TOTAL BY CONSTRUCTION: every failure is logged, never thrown. Callers are
 * teardown paths (`SpawnHandle.kill`, `signal` abort handlers, `pipeToRunLog`)
 * where a throw would wedge a run at `'running'` with its tailers parked.

  /**
   * Tear the sandbox down: kill the process tree we own, then (only if the dir
   * is ours) remove it.
   *
   * THE KILL IS UNCONDITIONAL, and must stay that way. `removeOnDestroy` is a
   * statement about the DIRECTORY — "this root is mine to delete" — and says
   * nothing about the processes. Gating {@link terminateChildren} behind it made
   * `destroy()` return immediately for the natural configuration of an app
   * pointed at its own checkout (`dir` set ⇒ `removeOnDestroy` defaults false),
   * leaving the whole spawned tree alive and holding its ports. Closing an IO
   * stream does not kill an in-sandbox process — that premise is stated
   * explicitly by `withSandbox`'s `onAbort` — so `terminateChildren` IS the only
   * thing that ends them, and it is exactly the leak the `killTree` work exists
   * to close.
   *
   * When the backing dir IS ours to remove, the children must additionally go
   * first and their exit MUST be confirmed: their CWD is that dir, and a `rm`
   * that races the OS releasing the handle fails with `EBUSY` on Windows. That
   * race was observable — `ai-acp` and `ai-grok-build` both lost tests per run
   * to `EBUSY … rmdir` — and it is the same failure shape as the `killTree`
   * work: a teardown that returned before the OS had caught up.
   *
   * COST, measured on Windows 11 and deliberately accepted: when a child really
   * is still alive this takes SECONDS (`sh -c ps` ~1.9s plus `taskkill /T`
   * ~1.9-3.0s), because `taskkill /T` is the only thing that reaches a native
   * grandchild — MSYS `ps` does not even list one. When every child has already
   * exited — the common case, since `close` drops them from `liveChildren` — the
   * kill is skipped entirely and this costs ~1ms. A caller that destroys a
   * sandbox whose agent is STILL RUNNING inside a tight per-test timeout will
   * feel those seconds, and `@tanstack/ai-acp`'s 5s-budget stdio tests do. The
   * alternatives are worse: the `EBUSY` rejection this removes, plus a leaked
   * process tree that outlives the run.
