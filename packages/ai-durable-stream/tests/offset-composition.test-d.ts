/**
 * Compile-time proof that the REAL durable-stream backend composes with
 * `@tanstack/ai-sandbox`'s run driver and reaper.
 *
 * This is the integration counterpart to
 * `packages/ai-sandbox/tests/offset-generics.test-d.ts`, which asserts the same
 * threading against a locally-declared branded offset (the sandbox package must
 * not depend on a durability backend). Here the actual `durableStream` is used,
 * so the assertion covers the composition an application really writes.
 *
 * THE BUG THIS PINS. `durableStream` returns
 * `StreamDurability<DurableStreamOffset>`. `StreamDurability` is contravariant
 * in its offset (`read` takes one), so that type is NOT assignable to
 * `StreamDurability<string>`. While `SandboxRunDriverOptions.durability` and
 * `ReapOptions.durability` hardcoded the `string` default, this file's
 * assignments failed with:
 *
 * ```
 * error TS2322: Type '(runId: string) => StreamDurability<DurableStreamOffset>'
 *   is not assignable to type '(runId: string) => StreamDurability<string>'.
 *     Types of property 'read' are incompatible.
 *       Types of parameters 'offset' and 'offset' are incompatible.
 *         Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'DurableStreamOffset'.
 * ```
 *
 * i.e. the Cloudflare-backed production durability path — the one the sandbox
 * docs point people at for multi-host durability — could not be wired without a
 * cast.
