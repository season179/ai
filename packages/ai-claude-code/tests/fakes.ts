// `@tanstack/ai-sandbox`'s journal reader picks a "follow" strategy
// (`tail -c +N -f journal | base64`, piped through a spawned `SpawnHandle`)
// whenever `capabilities.backgroundProcesses && capabilities.killableProcesses`
// — true for `local-process`. On this host that pipeline's downstream
// `base64` fully buffers its stdout (it isn't a tty and `tail -f` never
// closes its input), so nothing is ever flushed to the reader for a payload
// under one buffer's worth — the read hangs forever even though the journal
// file itself is complete and correct. The bounded "poll" strategy
// (`tail -c +N journal | base64`, no `-f`) has no such problem: each poll is a
// one-shot process that flushes its buffer on exit. `journalReadStrategy`
// decides purely from `handle.capabilities`, so reporting
// `killableProcesses: false` on the handle we hand the adapter steers it onto
// the poll path without touching `@tanstack/ai-sandbox` or the adapter itself
// — every other operation (fs, process.exec, destroy) still goes through the
// real local-process sandbox unchanged.
/**
 * Force the bounded-poll read strategy, and record every command the adapter
 * spawns/execs so the journal wiring can be asserted from the command itself.
 *
 * Recording the command is the only durable way to prove journal options
 * reached `spawnNdjson`: the journal is deleted once the run reaches its
 * `{"__exit":N}` sentinel, so by the time a test can look, a correctly
 * journaled run and an unjournaled one both leave no file behind.
