/**
 * Durability made `runId` CALLER-chosen, and this adapter interpolates it into
 * TWO filesystem paths:
 *
 * 1. the MCP bridge config, `${cwd}/.tanstack-mcp-bridge-${runId}.json`, whose
 *    bare filename is also handed to claude as `--mcp-config` RELATIVE to its
 *    cwd; and
 * 2. the stdin-fallback prompt file, `/tmp/tanstack-claude-prompt-${runId}`,
 *    taken when `sandbox.capabilities.writableStdin === false`.
 *
 * Raw, each is three hazards at once — a `/` silently turns the basename into a
 * nested path, `..` climbs out of the directory, and an over-long id fails the
 * spawn with `ENAMETOOLONG`. Both therefore go through `encodeRunId`, the same
 * encoder `journalPaths` uses, computed ONCE so the two filenames cannot drift.
 *
 * WHAT TO ASSERT, precisely. The encoded token still CONTAINS `..` — `.` is a
 * pass-through-safe character, so `encodeRunId('..')` is `'..'`. That is not a
 * defect, and asserting its absence would assert the wrong thing. Traversal is
 * defeated by escaping the SEPARATOR: with no `/` in the token, `..` is inert
 * text inside a single path segment with nothing to climb. These tests pin the
 * absence of `/` and the exact single-segment shape, never the absence of `..`.
 *
 * This is path safety, not shell injection: `q()` already quotes every value
 * reaching a shell, and these assertions deliberately do not re-test it.
