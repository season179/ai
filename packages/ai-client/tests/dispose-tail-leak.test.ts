 * will ever abort that tail, and a browser allows only ~6 connections per origin,
 * so a handful of thread switches starves the page: every later request queues.
 *
 * Measured before the fix, with three runs and ten thread switches: tails climbed
 * to 6 and stopped there, and an in-page fetch then took 93 SECONDS while the
 * identical request from outside the browser took 17ms. The visible symptoms were
 * the message disappearing, no UI updates until a run finished, and a 40s reload.
