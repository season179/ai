## Trying Out Lazy Tool Discovery

This example includes three **lazy tools** — tools that are not sent to the LLM upfront. Instead, the LLM sees a `__lazy__tool__discovery__` tool that lists their names. When the LLM needs one, it discovers it first (getting the full description and schema), then calls it normally.

The lazy tools are: `compareGuitars`, `calculateFinancing`, and `searchGuitars`.

### Test Prompts

**Compare guitars** — triggers discovery of `compareGuitars`:

> "Can you compare the Motherboard Guitar and the Racing Guitar for me?"

**Financing** — triggers discovery of `calculateFinancing`:

> "How much would it cost per month if I financed the Superhero Guitar over 12 months?"

**Search** — triggers discovery of `searchGuitars`:

> "Do you have any guitars with LED lights or tech features?"

**Multi-discovery** — triggers discovery of multiple lazy tools at once:

> "I'm looking for acoustic guitars. Can you search for them, then compare the ones you find, and show me financing options for the cheapest one?"

**Self-correction** — the LLM may try calling a lazy tool directly without discovering it first. It will get an error telling it to discover first, then self-correct:

> "Compare guitar 1 and guitar 4 right now"

### What to watch for

- The LLM calls `__lazy__tool__discovery__` before using a lazy tool for the first time
- After discovery, the tool is called directly like any normal tool
- In multi-turn conversations, previously discovered tools are usable immediately without re-discovery
- If the LLM skips discovery, it gets an error and self-corrects

## Routing

This project uses [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router). The initial setup is a file based router. Which means that the routes are managed as files in `src/routes`.

### Adding A Route

To add a new route to your application just add another a new file in the `./src/routes` directory.

TanStack will automatically generate the content of the route file for you.

Now that you have two routes you can use a `Link` component to navigate between them.

### Adding Links

To use SPA (Single Page Application) navigation you will need to import the `Link` component from `@tanstack/react-router`.

```tsx
import { Link } from '@tanstack/react-router'
```

Then anywhere in your JSX you can use it like so:

```tsx
<Link to="/about">About</Link>
```

This will create a link that will navigate to the `/about` route.

More information on the `Link` component can be found in the [Link documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/v1/docs/framework/react/api/router/linkComponent).

### Using A Layout

In the File Based Routing setup the layout is located in `src/routes/__root.tsx`. Anything you add to the root route will appear in all the routes. The route content will appear in the JSX where you use the `<Outlet />` component.

Here is an example layout that includes a header:

```tsx
import { Outlet, createRootRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { TanStackRouterDevtools } from '@tanstack/react-router-devtools'

import { Link } from '@tanstack/react-router'

export const Route = createRootRoute({
  component: () => (
    <>
      <header>
        <nav>
          <Link to="/">Home</Link>
          <Link to="/about">About</Link>
        </nav>
      </header>
      <Outlet />
      <TanStackRouterDevtools />
    </>
  ),
})
```

The `<TanStackRouterDevtools />` component is not required so you can remove it if you don't want it in your layout.

More information on layouts can be found in the [Layouts documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/routing-concepts#layouts).

## Data Fetching

There are multiple ways to fetch data in your application. You can use TanStack Query to fetch data from a server. But you can also use the `loader` functionality built into TanStack Router to load the data for a route before it's rendered.

For example:

```tsx
const peopleRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: '/people',
  loader: async () => {
    const response = await fetch('https://swapi.dev/api/people')
    return response.json() as Promise<{
      results: {
        name: string
      }[]
    }>
  },
  component: () => {
    const data = peopleRoute.useLoaderData()
    return (
      <ul>
        {data.results.map((person) => (
          <li key={person.name}>{person.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    )
  },
})
```

Loaders simplify your data fetching logic dramatically. Check out more information in the [Loader documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/data-loading#loader-parameters).

### React-Query

React-Query is an excellent addition or alternative to route loading and integrating it into you application is a breeze.

First add your dependencies:

```bash
pnpm add @tanstack/react-query @tanstack/react-query-devtools
```

Next we'll need to create a query client and provider. We recommend putting those in `main.tsx`.

```tsx
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query'

// ...

const queryClient = new QueryClient()

// ...

if (!rootElement.innerHTML) {
  const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(rootElement)

  root.render(
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <RouterProvider router={router} />
    </QueryClientProvider>,
  )
}
```

You can also add TanStack Query Devtools to the root route (optional).

```tsx
import { ReactQueryDevtools } from '@tanstack/react-query-devtools'

const rootRoute = createRootRoute({
  component: () => (
    <>
      <Outlet />
      <ReactQueryDevtools buttonPosition="top-right" />
      <TanStackRouterDevtools />
    </>
  ),
})
```

Now you can use `useQuery` to fetch your data.

```tsx
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query'

import './App.css'

function App() {
  const { data } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['people'],
    queryFn: () =>
      fetch('https://swapi.dev/api/people')
        .then((res) => res.json())
        .then((data) => data.results as { name: string }[]),
    initialData: [],
  })

  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        {data.map((person) => (
          <li key={person.name}>{person.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

You can find out everything you need to know on how to use React-Query in the [React-Query documentation](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/overview).

## State Management

Another common requirement for React applications is state management. There are many options for state management in React. TanStack Store provides a great starting point for your project.

First you need to add TanStack Store as a dependency:

```bash
pnpm add @tanstack/store
```

Now let's create a simple counter in the `src/App.tsx` file as a demonstration.

```tsx
import { useStore } from '@tanstack/react-store'
import { Store } from '@tanstack/store'
import './App.css'

const countStore = new Store(0)

function App() {
  const count = useStore(countStore)
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => countStore.setState((n) => n + 1)}>
        Increment - {count}
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

One of the many nice features of TanStack Store is the ability to derive state from other state. That derived state will update when the base state updates.

Let's check this out by doubling the count using derived state.

```tsx
import { useStore } from '@tanstack/react-store'
import { Store, Derived } from '@tanstack/store'
import './App.css'

const countStore = new Store(0)

const doubledStore = new Derived({
  fn: () => countStore.state * 2,
  deps: [countStore],
})
doubledStore.mount()

function App() {
  const count = useStore(countStore)
  const doubledCount = useStore(doubledStore)

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => countStore.setState((n) => n + 1)}>
        Increment - {count}
      </button>
      <div>Doubled - {doubledCount}</div>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

We use the `Derived` class to create a new store that is derived from another store. The `Derived` class has a `mount` method that will start the derived store updating.

Once we've created the derived store we can use it in the `App` component just like we would any other store using the `useStore` hook.

You can find out everything you need to know on how to use TanStack Store in the [TanStack Store documentation](https://tanstack.com/store/latest).

## Persistent chat (`/persistent-chat`)

A chat that survives a full page reload on both ends. The client writes the
transcript to `localStorage` (via `localStoragePersistence`), so a reload
restores the conversation instantly. The server writes the same transcript,
run records, and interrupt state to SQLite with `withPersistence`, so it
survives a server restart too — the DB lives at `.data/persistent-chat.db`
(gitignored). The SQLite backend is `src/lib/sqlite-persistence.ts`, a
self-contained `node:sqlite` store built on the `@tanstack/ai-persistence`
core store contracts — a worked example of rolling your own adapter.

Try it: send a message, wait for the reply, then reload the page. The
conversation is still there. Needs `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env`.

## Sandboxes — GitHub issue triage (`/sandboxes`)

Pick a harness adapter (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode) and a sandbox
provider (Docker, local process, Vercel, Daytona), paste a GitHub **issue URL**,
and the agent clones that repo into a sandbox, investigates read-only, and
reports whether the bug is still relevant and its root cause — streaming tool
calls and file activity live.

### Providers

- **Docker** — needs a running Docker daemon. The agent runs in a `node:22`
  container; the harness CLI is installed on first create. Heavy investigations
  can OOM the Docker VM (you'll see `exited with code 137`) — raise Docker
  Desktop's memory (Settings → Resources) if so.
- **Local process** — runs the chosen CLI directly on your host (no isolation;
  dev only). On **Windows** the agent runs through git-bash/WSL `sh` (auto-located
  from `git` on PATH; override with `TANSTACK_SANDBOX_SH`), since commands use
  POSIX quoting — install Git for Windows, or set `TANSTACK_SANDBOX_SH`.
- **Vercel** — `VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN` (run `vercel env pull`), **or** `VERCEL_TOKEN`
  - `VERCEL_TEAM_ID` + `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`. (Token alone falls back to OIDC and
    fails.) OIDC tokens are short-lived — re-pull when they expire.
- **Daytona** — `DAYTONA_API_KEY`.

### Harness keys

Set the chosen harness's key in `.env.local` (read by the dev server):
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (Claude Code / OpenCode), `CODEX_API_KEY` (Codex).
For **sandboxed** providers (Docker/Vercel/Daytona)
the key is injected into the sandbox; for **local process** the host CLI uses
your own host auth (the env key, or a `claude login`). Optional `GITHUB_TOKEN`
for private repos / higher rate limits.

### Use your Claude subscription instead of the API (no API billing)

When running **Claude Code on the Local process provider**, tick **“use my
subscription”** to bill your logged-in Claude Pro/Max account instead of the
Anthropic API. It works by scrubbing `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from the spawned
`claude`'s environment so the CLI falls back to your `claude login` credentials:

```ts
import { localProcessSandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox-local-process'

// Drop env vars before spawning so the host CLI uses its own stored auth.
localProcessSandbox({ scrubEnv: ['ANTHROPIC_API_KEY'] })
```

Requires `claude login` (a Pro/Max subscription) on the host. Only local-process
can do this — sandboxed providers have no host login, so they always use an API
key. (The `-p` headless flag is unrelated to billing; it's just streaming mode.)

### Tool bridge & code mode

The triage run passes two `chat()` tools to the harness to exercise the
**sandbox tool bridge** (host tools, called by the agent running inside the
sandbox). The system prompt forces both before any repo work, so a broken
bridge is obvious:

- `fetchIssueComments` — a normal server tool (host fetches the issue thread).
- `searchRelatedIssues` — exposed via **code mode**: the agent calls
  `execute_typescript`, and the generated code invokes
  `external_searchRelatedIssues(...)` (run on a host isolate).

The bridge is a **localhost** HTTP server, so it's only directly reachable from
same-machine providers (**local process**, **Docker**). For **remote** cloud
sandboxes (Daytona, Vercel) the agent can't dial your laptop — set
`NGROK_AUTHTOKEN` and the example tunnels the bridge out over ngrok so the tools
work there too (the per-run bearer token still gates every call). Without it,
cloud runs skip the tools and do a plain triage. In production you wouldn't need
ngrok — your orchestrator already has a public URL to advertise.

Set keys in `.env.local`, then `pnpm dev` and open `/sandboxes`.
