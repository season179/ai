/**
 * Image generation with SERVER-side persistence — the other half of the
 * client-driven adapter in `generation-persistence.ts`.
 *
 * `withGenerationPersistence` records each run in `stores.generationRuns` and,
 * because this backend also has `artifacts` + `blobs`, copies the generated
 * bytes out of the provider's expiring URL into our own store. `artifactUrl`
 * then stamps an app-origin serve URL onto every ref and rewrites the live
 * result to it — so both the live and the restored image render from here.
 *
 * The stores are SQLite-backed, so a generated image is still there after a
 * dev-server restart — reload the page and it renders from the database.
 *
 * The bytes themselves are served by the shared `/api/artifacts` route, which
 * every generation activity here shares.
 *
 * Chunks are also logged for replay (see `../lib/generation-durability`), so
 * the GET does two independent jobs, like the persistent-chat route: a
 * `joinRun` delivery replay when the request carries a resume offset, and
 * otherwise the `?threadId=` mount hydration that `persistence: true` calls.
