// `dockerode` is a server-only dependency that pulls in optional native addons
// (`ssh2` → `cpu-features`, a `.node` binary that this install does not compile).
// At runtime `ssh2` catches the missing addon, but the bundlers don't:
//   • esbuild's dev-time dep pre-bundler (`optimizeDeps`) hard-errors trying to
//     resolve `cpufeatures.node` → `optimizeDeps.exclude` keeps it out of the scan.
//   • the SSR build would try to inline it → `ssr.external` keeps it a runtime
//     require.
// This example uses nitro 3. Its server build (rolldown) externalizes
// node_modules by default, but must resolve each external to a real path.
// Under pnpm these server-only deps are only reachable via a workspace
// adapter's nested store dir, so a bare resolve from this example fails —
// they are therefore declared as direct dependencies here (dockerode,
// @anthropic-ai/sdk, @elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js) so nitro can resolve and
// trace them. The vite-level guards below still cover the client/SSR passes.
//
// `@anthropic-ai/sdk` (via @tanstack/ai-claude-code) ships a
// `tools/agent-toolset/fs-util.mjs` sub-module that imports `node:crypto`,
// `node:fs`, `node:path` — hard build errors if Rollup tries to resolve them
// in the client bundle. The SDK is only used server-side; mark it external so
// both the client Rollup pass and the SSR/nitro build resolve it at runtime.
// `@ngrok/ngrok` (used by src/ngrok-bridge.ts to tunnel the tool bridge to cloud
// sandboxes) loads a platform-specific `.node` native binary — esbuild's
// optimizer has no loader for it and the SSR/nitro builds must not inline it.

// Dev-only workaround for a nitro dev-middleware heuristic.
//
// `nitro/dist/_build/vite.dev.mjs` decides whether a request is a static asset
// (and so must NOT reach the server) from `Sec-Fetch-Dest`:
//
//   isAsset = fetchDest && fetchDest !== 'empty'
//     ? !/^(?:document|iframe|frame)$/.test(fetchDest)
//     : isAssetByExt
//
// Anything that isn't a document — `image`, `audio`, `video`, `script`, `font`
// — is treated as an asset and falls through to vite's static middleware,
// which has no file to serve and 404s with the connect `Cannot GET` page. The
// extension branch is only consulted when the header is absent/`empty`, so
// renaming the route doesn't help.
//
// It only bites routes nitro sees under Start's catch-all `/**` (an explicitly
// registered nitro route short-circuits the check), which is every server route
// here. So `<img src="/api/artifacts?id=…">` 404s in dev while the same URL
// fetched from JS returns the bytes — and production is unaffected, since this
// middleware only exists in the vite dev server.
//
// Presenting `empty` for our own API paths routes them back to the server
// without changing what the browser actually sends.
