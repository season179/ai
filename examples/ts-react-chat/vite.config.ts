// `dockerode` is a server-only dependency that pulls in optional native addons
// (`ssh2` → `cpu-features`, a `.node` binary that this install does not compile).
// At runtime `ssh2` catches the missing addon, but the bundlers don't:
//   • esbuild's dev-time dep pre-bundler (`optimizeDeps`) hard-errors trying to
//     resolve `cpufeatures.node` → `optimizeDeps.exclude` keeps it out of the scan.
//   • the SSR build would try to inline it → `ssr.external` keeps it a runtime
//     require.
// This example uses nitro 3. Its server build (rolldown) externalizes
// node_modules by default, but must resolve each external to a real path.
// Under pnpm these server-only deps are only reachable via a workspace
// adapter's nested store dir, so a bare resolve from this example fails —
// they are therefore declared as direct dependencies here (dockerode,
// @anthropic-ai/sdk, @elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js) so nitro can resolve and
// trace them. The vite-level guards below still cover the client/SSR passes.
//
// `@anthropic-ai/sdk` (via @tanstack/ai-claude-code) ships a
// `tools/agent-toolset/fs-util.mjs` sub-module that imports `node:crypto`,
// `node:fs`, `node:path` — hard build errors if Rollup tries to resolve them
// in the client bundle. The SDK is only used server-side; mark it external so
// both the client Rollup pass and the SSR/nitro build resolve it at runtime.
// `@ngrok/ngrok` (used by src/ngrok-bridge.ts to tunnel the tool bridge to cloud
// sandboxes) loads a platform-specific `.node` native binary — esbuild's
// optimizer has no loader for it and the SSR/nitro builds must not inline it.
