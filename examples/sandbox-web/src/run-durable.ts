/**
 * Durable-run wiring for the sandbox-web example — the journal-only tier of
 * durable runs (see docs/sandbox/durable-runs), in one module the routes share:
 *
 * - one `memoryPersistence()` so the run record, the transcript, and the
 *   delivery log all live in THIS process (zero infra — which also means a dev
 *   server restart forgets everything; that is the tier's documented trade);
 * - `buildRunStream`, the ONE chat() assembly both the fresh-run POST and the
 *   takeover GET use, so a replayed run re-derives the exact same stream;
 * - `driveRun`, the takeover drive (`durability.attach: true`) shared by the
 *   attach route and the reaper;
 * - `ensureReaper`, the scheduled sweep durable runs require (a detached run
 *   nobody rejoins must not keep its sandbox alive forever).
 *
 * The whole module is small because the stack is FIXED (Claude Code on Docker):
 * takeover requires rebuilding a run's chat() from its `runId` alone, and with
 * one adapter and one provider the rebuild is just `threadId` → sandbox +
 * transcript. Make the stack a per-request browser choice and every route that
 * arrives with only a `runId` needs that choice stored server-side — which is
 * most of the wiring this example used to carry.
 *
 * The `InMemoryLockStore` is fine here ONLY because this example is one
 * process. On real replicas it cannot stop two hosts driving one run — use a
 * distributed LockStore (see docs/sandbox/takeover, "Requirements").
