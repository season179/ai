Fix generation mount hydration to run in the commit phase, and restore TTS
results.

- The `GenerationClient` / `VideoGenerationClient` used to kick off mount
  hydration from their constructor. Framework hooks build the client inside
  `useMemo`, so that ran in React's render phase, and several clients mounting
  together re-fired the hydrate GET on every discarded/speculative render,
  flooding the connection pool (`ERR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES`). Hydration now runs once from `mountDevtools`
  (the hooks' commit-phase mount effect), guarded by `serverHydrationStarted`.
  Note for direct
  (non-framework) `GenerationClient`/`VideoGenerationClient` users: mount
  hydration and the "missing `hydrateGeneration` handler" warning now fire from
  `mountDevtools()` rather than the constructor, so call `mountDevtools()` (as
  every framework hook does on mount) to trigger a server/storage restore;
  `generate()` still triggers it too.
- New `reconstructSpeechResult` mapper, wired into the speech hook of **every**
  framework package — `useGenerateSpeech` (React, Solid, Vue),
  `createGenerateSpeech` (Svelte) and `injectGenerateSpeech` (Angular). A
  restored `TTSResult` carries no base64 bytes (they live in the blob store), so
  it surfaces the durable serve URL through `result.artifacts`; the speech clip
  now repaints after a reload instead of showing status only. Previously only
  React was wired, so a restored TTS run on the other four repainted
  `status`/`error` but left `result` null.
