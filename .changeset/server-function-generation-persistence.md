Make generation persistence work with server functions and direct connections. Server-driven restore (`persistence: true`) previously only worked with the HTTP adapters (`fetchServerSentEvents` / `fetchHttpStream` and their XHR variants), because they are the only connections that implement the optional `hydrateGeneration(threadId)` and `joinRun(runId)` handlers; with `stream()`, `rpcStream()`, or a plain `fetcher` the option silently no-opped, and a stored snapshot still `running` after a reload left the hook stuck on `generating` forever.

**Handlers on the lightweight adapters (`@tanstack/ai-client`).** `stream()` and `rpcStream()` take an optional second argument, `StreamConnectionHandlers` (`{ hydrate, hydrateGeneration, joinRun }`), spread onto the returned adapter so server-driven persistence works without an HTTP endpoint — each handler is typically a one-line server-function or RPC call. `ConnectConnectionAdapter` also declares the optional chat `hydrate` handler alongside the generation ones.

**Handlers as generation options (`@tanstack/ai-client`).** `GenerationClientOptions` (and `VideoGenerationClientOptions`, plus every framework hook's generation options) accept optional `hydrateGeneration` / `joinRun` alongside a `fetcher` — or as a fallback when a connection doesn't carry its own. `persistence: true` now hydrates whenever either source exists; the constructor warning only fires when neither does.

**Interrupted runs no longer stick on `generating` (`@tanstack/ai-client`).** A restored or hydrated snapshot with `status: 'running'` that no `joinRun` handler can tail is repainted as an interrupted error — an interrupted generation cannot be resumed, only re-run — in both `GenerationClient` and `VideoGenerationClient`.

**Request-free hydration (`@tanstack/ai-persistence`).** New `getGenerationHydration(persistence, id, { by?: 'threadId' | 'runId' })` returns the plain `{ resumeSnapshot, activeRun }` payload straight from the `generationRuns` store, so a server function can back `hydrateGeneration` without fabricating a `Request`. `reconstructGeneration` now delegates to it; `authorize` stays on the `Request`-based function only, so server-function callers gate on their own session before resolving the id.

**Server-function run replay (`@tanstack/ai`).** `memoryStream` also accepts an explicit `{ runId, offset? }` init instead of a `Request`, and a new `replayRunStream(durability, offset?)` async generator maps a durability `read` (from the start by default) to a bare `StreamChunk` stream — together they let a streaming server function serve `joinRun` for a run id it received as call data.
